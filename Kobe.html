              <h2>THE HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL KING HITS THE NBA</h2>
              <p> Kobe Bryant spent his high school career in Philadelphia from 1991-1995, coming to the 1996 NBA draft fresh off a hot streak of four state championships with Lower Merion High School. He ended his high school days as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time leading scorer, with 2,883 points, surpassing even Wilt Chamberlain.Though he had also achieved good grades and high SAT-scores, he had numbers higher than 1600 on his mind. Bryant became one of just a handful of players at the time to jump straight from high school to the NBA draft. The Charlotte Hornets used their 13th overall pick on him, but ended up trading him to the L.A. Lakers, where he would spend the rest of his career. </p>

              <h2>THE ROOKIE MISTAKE</h2>
              <p>Kobe Bryant didn't start out as a dominant force, but he did soon become one. Los Angeles Daily News credits this to the infamous "airball game," a 1997 losing effort at the Western Conference semifinals. Bryant, an 18-year-old rookie, airballed no less than four free throws — entirely missing the rim and the backboard. The embarrassment made him focus and train extra hard to great effect, and today, many consider this single game to be a defining moment in his career.Despite the hiccups, Kobe was already looking promising, and would soon join the starting lineup, making him the youngest player to ever start an NBA game — a record that stands to this day. </p>

He played on the Western Conference team alongside Tim Duncan, Gary Payton, and fellow Laker Shaq, among others. Though the Western Conference would lose 135-114, Kobe would go on to make another 17 All-Star appearances. </p>

              <h2>CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT</h2>
              <p> The year 2003 saw dark clouds gather over Kobe Bryant's name. The basketball superstar was charged with sexual assault of a 19-year-old front desk clerk at the Lodge & Spa at Cordillera in Edwards, Colorado. The woman said Bryant assaulted her in his hotel room, and the extremely high-profile case would take 14 months to resolve. With his wife Vanessa at his side, Bryant admitted to cheating on her, but insisted he was otherwise innocent. Nevertheless, the incident was a heavy blow to his reputation. </p>

              <h2>TIMES OF TURMOIL</h2>
              <p> 2004 was a particularly turbulent year for Kobe Bryant. He played brilliantly and the Lakers made it to the finals, and he even locked in a cool seven-year contract with the team that was worth $136 million. However, he was often flying between his day job and dealing with his criminal court situation with the "Jane Doe" accusing him of sexual assault. Though she dropped the criminal suit, the woman did file a civil lawsuit against Bryant for an "unspecified amount of damages." </p>

              <p> 2005 brought an end to Kobe Bryant's legal nightmare, as he settled with his accuser. The terms of the settlement are unknown. His day job kept giving him grief, Bryant was essentially the most hated man in the NBA for the 2004-2005 season, because people felt he had driven Shaquille O'Neal out of the team (and because of the whole sexual assault case situation, obviously). It didn't help that while Bryant himself played fairly well, the Lakers failed to reach playoffs that year. </p>

              <h2>THE U-TURN</h2>
              <p> Kobe Bryant had to enter the 2006 NBA season with a big ol' slice of humble pie in his hand. As Bleacher Report writes, his reputation was in tatters and he bore the brunt of the blame from the Lakers' recent failures. However, he ate it all without wincing, and went on to become the best Kobe Bryant he could possibly be. He played the absolute best season in his career, including a ridiculous 81-point game against the Toronto Raptors and a 62-point one against the Dallas Mavericks. He even managed to carry his otherwise underwhelming team back in the playoffs. There were other changes, too — he finally ended the longtime animosity with his rival, Shaquille O'Neal. </p>

In 2009, Bryant took his fourth NBA title and was named the MVP of the finals, while also speeding past Jerry West's record of "points scored as a Laker" (25,192). 2010 brought a fifth NBA title and another Finals MVP plaudit, along with a three-year contract extension that was worth $84 million. Kobe would ultimately earn $680 million in salary and endorsements over his two decade career– the most ever for a team athlete during their playing career. </p>

He was in hot water with the NBA for slinging an "anti-gay slur" at a referee, and was eventually fined $100,000. Things were hardly better on the home front, either: Bryant's wife, Vanessa, decided to file for divorce.  </p>

Unfortunately, the other big Kobe news in 2013 were a mixed bag. Bryant had to file a lawsuit against his mother, Pamela, to prevent her from "auctioning off" all sorts of things from the early days of his career. He also ruptured his Achilles' tendon in a game — a potentially career-ending injury that required surgery and sidelined him for up to nine months. However, the Lakers were still happy to give the 35-year-old player a $48.5 million contract extension. </p>

              <p> It was always a given that the Los Angeles Lakers would retire Kobe Bryant's number, but which one? As he played the first half of his career with a No. 8 jersey. Kobe had always worn jersey numbers 24 and 33 during his youth, but when he joined the Lakers, neither was an option. George McCloud wore No. 24 and No. 33 had been retired in recognition of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. So he went with number 8, before switching to No. 24 before the 2006-2007 season. In 2017, the Lakers decided to just retire them both, and Bryant became the only man in NBA history to "have two numbers retired by the same team." </p>

Bryant would state that Phil Jackson served as an inspiration for the wizard trainer, as he would often burn incense, or make the Lakers practice Tai Chi. </p>

              <p> On January 26, 2020, Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gigi, died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, as TMZ tells us. All nine people onboard perished, and the world was left stunned. A man who began his career as an excellent athlete ended it as an icon and inspiration to millions the world over. On the court, his name became synonymous with success, to the point that people of all ages would yell "Kobe!" when their shot was on target. Off the court, he became a symbol of discipline and determination, and strove to lead others to a higher level. He began a second career as a storyteller, but his life itself was an epic tale bordering on myth. Though that life was tragically cut short, Kobe Bryant's legacy will live on. </p>
